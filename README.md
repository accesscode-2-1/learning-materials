Links to various learning materials. Originally from the `#learning_materials` channel on slack, now any and all resources should be brought over to this repo with a PR.

[The Beginner's Guide to Android Game Development](http://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Android-Game-Development/dp/1908689269), by James Cho.
> @kennychong: If anyone is interested in learning to build games in Java and Android.
> The author uses Eclipse IDE, but it shouldn't be too difficult to translate his tutorials to Android Studios.
> If you enjoy this book, please support the author by purchasing a copy. Thanks.

[Udacity Android Developers Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

> @tash.s: Announced during Google I/O this morning, Udacity has officially opened enrollment for a new Nanodegree for Android Developement. There is a free week trial and after that is $200 a month, check it out. 

> @jaellysbales: yeah, I also read that the top 50 students who complete the course will get to go the Google campus and meet hiring engineers at a summit closer to end of year. 

> @jaellysbales: $200/mo 9-12 months...I'm really glad we're at Access Code. :simple_smile:

> @ehtesh: a bunch of android resources I came across in the past. If you see something that should be placed here or is out of date, you should make an issue or PR against the original repo. I think the collaborators of those repositories would highly appreciate that, and it'll get you guys into the whole open source collaborative spirit.

[Coursera course equivalent of COS 226](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI)

> @ehtesh Data structures, algorithms, java, and it's free. Princeton is on top of their stuff. Good lectures too, but I have only gone through the first few.

> @ramonaharrison: This looks really great; it covers a lot of stuff I've been wanting to learn more about but haven't been sure where to start... 

> @ramonaharrison: hmm, so i can't figure out how to access the course material through coursera... i think it may not be available now. But i found the lectures are on youtube: <snip> , and it seems like the materials are all here: <snip>

[Video lectures for CSE 373](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtl7M3yp-DV69F32zdK7YJcNXpTunF2b)

> @ehtesh: This is the algorithms course I took on college. I absolutely loved it and would not mind going through again to refresh my memory. The course was taught in Java, but Skiena's book, [the Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202), uses C. Still, Skiena is a brilliant lecturer.
